Training materials for **Cloud Foundry for Beginners: from Zero to Hero** 

http://slides.cf-hero.cloudcredo.io

## Summary

Join us for a hands-on training workshop to learn about deploying and managing
applications on Cloud Foundry. We will give an overview of Cloud Foundry and
how it works, including specifics relating to services, buildpacks, and
architecture. We will also look at how to effectively work with Cloud Foundry
in your organisation.

This training is targeted at people with little or no Cloud Foundry experience
but some experience delivering web-based applications. If you're curious to
learn how Cloud Foundry can help you focus on development and innovation,
rather than infrastructure plumbing, this is the right course for you.
