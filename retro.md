Retrospectives help us understand the actions that we need to take in order to be more effective.

# CF Summit Berlin 2015 Retrospective

## Worked well

* Content fit the schedule perfectly (leisurely pace with plenty of time for questions)
    1st &amp; 2nd topic 09:00 - 10:30 (15' break)
    3rd &amp; 4th topic 10:45 - 12:00 (60' lunch break)
    5th &amp; 6th topic 13:00 - 14:30 (15' break)
    7th &amp; 8th topic 14:45 - 15:45
* Applications
    They were simple and effective, trainees liked them
* Hosted slides
    People could browse slides on their laptops, at their own pace.
    Rescued us from the white text on dark background mistake.

## Didn't work well

* cf login on Windows
    Run in Command Prompt, won't work in a terminal emulator.
* git on Windows
    Install with the Command Prompt option, otherwise it won't work in cmd.
* Dark backgrounds
    Hosted slides saved the day, projectors and dark backgrounds never work
* Small font sizes in web apps
    Text on web apps was impossible to read from the back of the room.
* Too much cf command output on the slides
    Use the terminal for that, respect the restriction imposed by the larger font size.
* Not mirroring displays
    While it was helpful to have the speaker notes on the secondary display,
    typing commands in a window on the projector was terrible.
* Text for features was too small
    They were important but hardly visible.
* Dark background on the code editor
    Even though we had very few code edits, the dark background made it difficult to see what was happening.

## Action points

Make the git in Terminal or Command Prompt on Windows a training pre-requisite.

Use black text on white background throughout the slides.

Use black text on white background in your code editor.

Make the Reveal.js theme code font-size bigger. Reduce cf command output.

Increase base font-size in web apps.

Mirror displays when delivering the training.
